# Socket.IO Alternatives for Netlify

## ❌ Socket.IO WebSockets on Netlify
**Not possible** - Netlify Functions are serverless and can't maintain persistent WebSocket connections.

## ✅ Working Solutions

### 1. HTTP Polling (Currently Implemented)
- ✅ Works on Netlify
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ❌ Less efficient (checks every 2 seconds)
- ❌ Higher latency

### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE) - Recommended
- ✅ Works with Netlify Functions
- ✅ Real-time one-way communication
- ✅ Lower latency than polling
- ✅ Better for server-to-client updates
- ❌ One-way only (server → client)

### 3. Third-Party Services
- **Pusher** - Full WebSocket support
- **Ably** - Real-time messaging
- **Firebase Realtime Database** - Google's solution
- ✅ Full Socket.IO-like functionality
- ✅ Works with Netlify
- ❌ Costs money (usually free tier available)

### 4. Hybrid Approach
- Static files on Netlify
- Socket.IO server on Railway/Render
- Connect dashboard to Railway server
- ✅ Full Socket.IO support
- ✅ Best performance
- ❌ Requires two deployments

## Current Implementation
Using **HTTP Polling** - checks `/api/qr` every 2 seconds for updates.

## Recommendation
For best performance: Use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** or deploy Socket.IO server to Railway.
